I'm Vishnu Murali Krishnan, a recent engineering graduate from NIT Warangal. I'm passionate about making tech, especially AI, accessible to everyone. My goal is to lower the barriers for people to leverage powerful AI tools without needing extensive tech know how. I'm driven by curiosity and a genuine eagerness to learn, I'm always ready to build, experiment, stumble and rise again stronger

## Experience

- **ML Engineer, Aerobotics7**: Guided the Machine Learning team in developing robust models for landmine detection using both visual imagery and a proprietary radar system. Designed and implemented efficient ETL pipelines for real-time sensor data ingestion and model inference, leveraging CUDA to significantly enhance data processing speeds. Additionally, I had the privilege of leading recruitment efforts in the ML team, thoughtfully interviewing talented interns and Senior ML engineers to build a cohesive, dynamic team.

- **ML Intern, Aerobotics7:** Engineered a data collection pipeline, optimizing it using multi-processing and multi-threading techniques to significantly improve performance. Contributed actively to annotating and preparing a large landmine dataset, which directly supported the development of reliable object detection models.

- **Additional Secretary, EA & HAM Club, NIT Warangal:** Facilitated numerous internal and external machine learning workshops, focusing on collaborative learning and practical skill development. Led a comprehensive summer ML guidance program, personally organizing quizzes, and offering support to juniors and peers, ensuring meaningful growth and clarity in their learnings.
